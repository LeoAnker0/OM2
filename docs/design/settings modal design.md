It's a fairly simple affair, but still important, since this will make it easier for when i am coding it up. The other parts of the project so far have been porting over basically the same thing from om1, with a few tweaks, whereas this is something that didn't properly exist before, which i am now having to design from scratch.

I have also upon reflection decided that the best thing to do for login/signup flow is to break it up into it's own modal as well.
I'm thinking that it would be good if it used the same blur/noise background as the above picture, but that the background should only be that and not a solid colour as well as also outlined in the above picture, and then it will use the same layout of arranging the elements of the form.

This will then work well with loading this when a user is not signed in at all.
