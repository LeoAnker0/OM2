# 20/9/23  - Making URL's Configurable

The title might not make the most sense at first glance however yesterday I made a commmit that made it so that the urls/domains that the JS file must access for data, was now configurable, outside of building it in. And first of all this was a convenience for me, meaning that I no longer had to remember to update the main.js before building the frontend. And it also meant that should anybody else wish to use OM2, they would be able to set it to their domains.
This all sounds simple enough, however due to my inexperience with either VITE, or nginx it took me a whole day of frustration to figure out how to do it.

I started out by seeing if there was a solution that existed already for this, and atleast for changing a variable by environment variables during build there was. This meant that the dev and build step could have seperate domains, so dev could have `testom2apis.domain.tld`, however because the built version had to be able to serve many people/domains, it couldn't be built into it, and instead I would have to find some solution that would allow me to change this after it was built, and this presented a problem. If I had taken the easy path I would just have said that people needed to build both the web portion, and then also build the docker images to be able to change two variables, and I thought there had to be a better solution. 

The VITE/JS code required to change the strings based on build type looks like"

```js
export const MAIN_CONST_EXPORT_apiPath =
    import.meta.env.VITE_API_DOMAIN;

export const MAIN_CONST_EXPORT_mediaPath =
    import.meta.env.VITE_MEDIA_DOMAIN;
```

Which is  really anticlimatic, however that's all you need for the javascript end, and then you also need two `.env` files, one called `.env.production` *(you need to the full name)*, and then one called `.env.development`, and the environment variables that you pass through must be prefixed by `VITE`, otherwise they won't be picked up by VITE for security reasons. And these `.env`'s look like so:

##### `.env.development`
```.env
VITE_API_DOMAIN=https://testom2apis.domain.tld
VITE_MEDIA_DOMAIN=https://testom2media.domain.tld
```

##### `.env.production`
```.env
VITE_API_DOMAIN=MAIN_API_DOMAIN
VITE_MEDIA_DOMAIN=MAIN_MEDIA_DOMAIN
```


I knew that I had to change the string from the deployed location, however it was hard to find information about this. So I tried to google, how do I change a variables value in javascript with NGINX, and well they were all suggesting that I use a rewrite instead, and change it so that in the build step the PRE url looks like `/apis/` instead of `https://om2apis.domain.tld` however no matter what I tried I was unable to get the rewriting to work, and besides I didn't really want to do it from the first.
So instead I want back to google, and found something called `sub_filter`, and this would allow me in NGINX to do exactly as I had wanted, to change the value of some text in a js file to whatever the user needed it to be. However it didn't work straight out, so I found this incredibly bizarre youtube video, [which starts out with a guy talking about mangos or whatever](https://youtu.be/EvCZySPE0I4?si=4T3TaZcO0aZw9R3i), but anyway about half way through there is a solution to the askers problem. And I realized that I had basically just forgotten to turn gzip off. and well it now works, And at the moment it is limited to having the urls specified in the conf file, however hopefully that should soon be changed to allowing it to be set by the `.env` file.

The conf that I ended up with  that allowed me to filter a couple of strings was this:

##### `nginx-frontend.conf`
```conf
server {
	... other rules ...

    location ~ \.js {
        gzip off;
        sub_filter_once off;
        sub_filter_types *;
        sub_filter 'MAIN_API_DOMAIN' 'https://om2apis.domain.tld';
        sub_filter 'MAIN_MEDIA_DOMAIN' 'https://om2media.domain.tld';
        sub_filter_types application/javascript;
        sub_filter_last_modified on;
    }
}

```
