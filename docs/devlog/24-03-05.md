So, I think that most things are at a usuable stage in OM2, and I sort of want to create/release a version of it, or something stable that I can keep running for a while privately.

So, therefore there are 10 things that I have to get in place:
- [ ] Ability to share a project with another user (no websockets version) (with access level)
- [ ] Ability to share to the internet with iframe, and direct file link
- [x] Ability for users to sign up
- [x] Ability for admin to delete a user
- [ ] Ability for a user to view their storage usage, and change username
- [ ] Hard set whole service storage limit, which cannot be overtrodden
- [x] Search
- [ ] Update/Redesign web requests/returns so that errors get handled in the same way in all places (FX: when the users access-token is no longer valid, get the user to sign in again)
- [ ] Easily Deployable Docker Images
- [ ] Updated README


Experimental Future Additions?
- [ ] Ability to use mobile version as a controller for desktop version, (but this would need to be really well done, to not cause massive annoyance and issues)
