So, I think that most things are at a usuable stage in OM2, and I sort of want to create/release a version of it, or something stable that I can keep running for a while privately.

So, therefore there are 7 things that I have to get in place:
* Ability for users to sign up
* Ability for admin to delete a user
* Ability for a user to view their storage usage, and change username
* Ability to share a project with another user (no websockets version) (with access level)
* Ability to share to the internet with iframe, and direct file link
* Updated README
* Hard set whole service storage limit, which cannot be overtrodden
