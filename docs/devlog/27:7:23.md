# Image and File solutions

At the moment i am in a bit of a situation, since i need to figure out how i am going to store the images and music files that will be a core part of my service.

And for this purpose i am going to layout how i am planning on solving this dilemna.

First of all when the apis recieve a  file that they need to put into the system they will have the file.

They will pass this file to our system. Let's call it chipmunk.

* And so then chipmunk will have a few duties, first of all to verify that there is enough space for the file within the allowance of the user who is trying to upload this file, as well as returning if the image is supposed to be square or not.

* If false, chipmunk will return an error message stating that the user has no more storage available for their account. 

* If true the file will proceed to the next step, generating a file ID (ensuring that the file ID is unique).

* With this file ID chipmunk will then move the original file to its new home, inside the folder with the name of it's owner ID, and inside here the file will stay.

* However chipmunk will then also go and generate several copies of this image, in various states of pixel size and compression, most importantly the images will be converted to .webp format, the images will have an extension of something like -1, or -3 and so on, and if needs be the images will be cropped to square. These will represent:
	* -1: the smallest version of the image, at 10 * 10px, and le max compression (at the most performant point)
	* -2: 40 * 40 px
	* -3: 160px * 160px with slightly less compression
	* -4: 320px * 320px again with slightly less compression
	* -5: 640px * 640px + less compression
	* -6: 1080px * 1080px probably the point where it will cap out
	* -0: will be the original image

* Chipmunk will also ensure that an nginx server or something like that is available to then serve the images, and the most important thing will be making it so that only authorized users can access their images/files since we wouldn't want any rando getting access to our valuable images, so i need to figure out how this works.

*basically to secure the images i can just make the urls a completelty random value, and then when it is requested nginx can then check against what it would otherwise be and get the real value i think*
