I'm currently working on styling the topleft stuff, so normal searchbar and the buttons that will appear there.
And previously i was using an outline around the searchbar, but since i wanted to try experimenting with using a gradient outline instead of block colour when it is focused, i am currently using a hacky before selector.

What i need to do now is to write some JS code that will detect when the searchbar is focused, so that i can make changes to the css. The changes i want to make are specifically for the outline, from a grey to the coloured and back. and also to make the empty search query button work.

After that i would want to implement the features that allow for actually clearing the input, as well as console logging it for now, upon hitting enter.
