Basically not a lot to say, other than when using a css variable for a backdrop filter, that will not work when you then build/deploy it. And I don't know why, but that is just the way it is.

```css
:root {
	--filter: blur(10px);
}

element {
	backdrop-filter: var(--filter);
}

```

^ the above will not work when we ship it. So instead you need to do like below.

```css
element {
	backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
}
```

And basically what we learn from that, is that it is okay to use the variable whilst making the filter, so that it is easier to change, however, for deployment you must specify it.
