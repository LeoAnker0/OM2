# Backend/Frontend considerations

I am at the point right now, where the majority of the front end is finished, i still need to make the upload page, however this is something that i will make in it's most rudimentary stage, and will instead focus on getting that backend fronted connection working.
As far as i am concerned the main components of the backend are:
* Database, postgres, fairly important (will store account details, project details, and such)
* Img storage, this will be done through pictshare (it has an api)
* Cloudflared for domained internet access
* Music Storage, i think this will be handled either through pictshare??? or through a custom thingy.


Also for the login flow, it will work by, if you aren't currently a member, it will send an email to your *email*, and will give you the option of signing up through a form (which i should make about now).
