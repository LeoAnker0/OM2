# Backend/Frontend considerations

I am at the point right now, where the majority of the front end is finished, i still need to make the upload page, however this is something that i will make in it's most rudimentary stage, and will instead focus on getting that backend fronted connection working.
As far as i am concerned the main components of the backend are:
* Database, postgres, fairly important (will store account details, project details, and such)
* Img storage, this will be done through pictshare (it has an api)
* Cloudflared for domained internet access
* Music Storage, i think this will be handled either through pictshare??? or through a custom thingy.


Also for the login flow, it will work by, if you aren't currently a member, it will send an email to your *email*, and will give you the option of signing up through a form (which i should make about now).

---

I now have a server up and running for use with this project, the next steps will be getting my database initialised and finding a viable method of developing it locally, along with setting it up on the server where it would be deployed.

---

I suppose the correct thing to do now would be to draw out the different flow diagrams, since that would really help me understand what it is that I want the user to be able to do, and therefore what it is that i need to build.

Those being:

#### Frontend - ish
* signup
	* entering details
	* checking the email against the database and ensuring that the email isn't already there.
		* if the email is new, then proceed
		* else go back to step one with error message stating that there was an error
	* taking the rest of the details and transferring them to the server, along with the image/picture which then needs to be moved over into wherever the images are stored and processed
	* send a message back to the frontend that the signup was successful, and then to redirect towards the main page

* login
	* enter details
	* send details to the serve for check
		* if correct send a jwt to the user and display success animation
		* else send error message, and tell the user to retry, and show the error indicator for logging in
	* tell the rest of the webpage to continue loading


#### Backendy - ish
* Image/Picture system
	* Take image as delivered from one of the backend services
	* generate an ID for this image
	* Process image, giving it a varierty of quality states, ranging from *ID*-1 being the  lowest quality at 10px * 10px, to *ID*-0 being the original quality, and i think we should serve our images in .webp
	* Update the Images database to state where the images are stored and their ID, as well as the user who owns that IMG

The only problem with the images here, is that the images need to be written to a file system, which need to be accessible to multiple docker containers, so i suppose this is where the docker volumes come in and docker compose, since it allows the connecting of multiple docker containers to one volume, which would then allow them to share.
