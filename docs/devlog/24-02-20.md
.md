# 24/02/20.md

It's been a while since I've updated the progress here. And this is partly because it just has been a process of creating a new database structure, doing things in the proper way (`startup.sh` for waiting to start main.go), and of course rewriting it all in golang as well.

All this being said, I've almost gotten everything over too golang, *along with all the new things that have been added*, and it will soon be time to try and figure out how to store lots and lots of audio/image files (> `10Gb`).
And I have theorised a system that could potentially work, but I would of course need to build it before it is I can know if it is adequate.

#### The current file flow goes like this:
* A user uploads a file to a destination
* The file is processed
* Database things happen
* The file gets stored at `/var/www/media/uuid/0.file`

#### When the user requests the file it goes like:
* Request `/media/uuid/1`
* Server looks for `/var/www/media/uuid/1.*`
* Returns


However this becomes a problem when we theoretically have 1000 users, and each user gets `10Gb` free, and then 50% pay for `150Gb`, and 10% pay for `500Gb`, this means that we need `((500 * 10) + (400 * 150) + (100 * 500)) `, this is `115_000Gb` or `115Tb`. That's more than is realistic to be able to store on a single server. Therefore we need some system whereby we can store this data elsewhere, and get it onto the server quickly for delivering to the user.

#### This system could look like:
* File is uploaded to server
* File is processed
* Database things happen
* The file is moved to `CloudStorage Land`

#### File is requested:
* Check if the file is already in the servers cache `(~100mb / user?)`, at `/var/www/media/cache/uuid/1.*`
* If it is, perfect, serve the file
* Else, Check if there is any extra space in the cache, if not, clear the oldest one
* Then retrieve the file from `CloudStorage Land`, move to cache
* Serve the file

***Possible structure for cache file system***
`/var/www/media/cache/uuid/1/time-in-unix-milis.file`
I think this system would be very effective, since it would make it relatively simple too check if `/uuid/1` existed, and if so, grab it, and then later when I want to remove the oldest I can change that.

***Other more likely structure***
`/var/www/media/uuid/*`
Modify files table so that it has a cached time field. And then if the check for the media hits a negative, it will download `uuid/*.file` to that directory, and then when emptying/tidying cache, it will be able to check the time that it was chached/last played, and i think last played is more important, so do that.


This is not a perfect system and I will need to do some more research, and most importantly I will need to make sure that the latency isn't too great, since that would kill it, and this is music streaming, so want to make sure that the user isn't waiting to long for it be returned.


### Current Reflections

All this talk of file storage is all good and all, however I do want to say that the current state of the app is really quite good, since the interface is solid, the admin tools are there, and will only really need a little bit more work in the future. The file uploader for big files is solid, and aesthetic now, as well as being informational (though could do with some more work for mobile to ensure that those users can still see the state of the upload).
And the current prerogative is just to polish and complete these core areas of the app, for example making all the menus for projects, and songs and so on do useful things, like currently allowing the deletion of individual songs in projects which is almost finished.
Soon the whole thing will be in a state where I want to start actively sharing it with others.
But I want to add object storage first, as a way of security that if there are any users who want to pay for it, they will be able to get everything that they are hoping too pay for. Plus allowing free trials and that sort of thing.

A few things, but not all that overwhelming I don't think.
