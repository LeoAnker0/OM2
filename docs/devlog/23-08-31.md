So what have we learned today/yesterday?

We have gotten the building of the docker images, pushing them remotely, and then running them with a prod docker compose working. This has meant changing how all the many configuration files were, *configured*, so that they would work when built as an image, and for an arm64 environment. But the good news is that I am at this very moment listening to music on the instance that I just deployed today. And as far as the things that can be done at the moment they all work, so it doesn't look like we will be too limited with the arm64 target.

Another good thing that happened was that I realised that instead of building the images locally, pushing them, and waiting forever, I can infact just git commit any changes, and then on the server (build server), git pull, and then build the image, and it works really well, because my internet is slow, and the server is remote and has fast internet, and there are no issues there.

These two days dedicated to getting deployment working haven't furthered the project interms of completion or functionality, but they do mean that now have the system for deploying the code, and it also means that going forward I will be able to deploy the code to the one server very easily, and that I'll be able to check the real use case/performance really easily. Also there is the fact that at the end of the day I would have had to do this anyway, and since i've done it now, at the point of minimum viability, it means that I can actually use the service, and check on wether I would actually use it, and what I would change. And there are obviously several things that I would change, however I'm going to say that the current version 0.0.1 is the perpetual 0.0.1, and that from this point on, the things that I want to be deploying should be version 0.0.2 and so on. Because it would actually be pretty cool to have a benchmark of where did we come from.
