 # Component Style/Construction Methodology

 When I decided to remake [orange music] from *scratch*, I did so explicitly because the way in which I made the old site was terrible. I had one large confusing index.html file, and when I was adding in new html content, I was doing that by keeping the html in a javascript variable, which is terrible; mostly because of the fact that there is no longer any type checking or autocomplete or all the easy things with working with html, in a html file.

Therefore when I was doing it all from the groundup again and using something new like vite, I decided that I should break my html into small little simple chunks, about 100 lines in length or so, but usually about 20, and just following the mentality of each file is doing one thing, and that most things should just be broken into their own chunks, because this makes it a whole lot easier to manage and to wrap your head around, because it's a small error in some little file, rather than being in a massive html file.

And this problem, of large complicated files, is something that I also faced with my CSS, at 2000 lines long, it was hard to keep track of what was, and what wasn't, and I am certain that in the original version there was code that wasn't being used, and this can partly be solved by build tools such as vite, but it is also something that can be tackled by making the dev process more simple, *or perhaps more logical*, and I've decided that this will be done in this project, by saying that every html file, will have it's own css file, and this just means that it will be so much easier to keep on top of what css goes where, and I will make sure to make it so that each html file, will correspond to a css file of same name, since this is the most logical way of proceeding.
Of course html, and CSS are nothing without JS, and my current idea, is that I will just do the same, so each individual page that needs a bit of JS for interactive reasons will have that in their own seperate files, so the searchbar page will have a file called searchbar.js, in which will be stored all the stuff associated with getting the input, making the clear button work, and then also sending that input away to the search system (and then also intialising the search results system; but this again raises an interesting question of how that should be handled, but I think the best solution for that is creating those export functions with inputs, where it will then recieve the different items to be displayed as a list, and will load those in some appropriate manner).

But this then reminds me of another important factor that I want to stress, that an individual javascript function should not both be dealing with event listeners, and then also doing something with those events, instead these should be split into two different sections. An example of this, would be the audio engine, rather than it both detecting clicks and such, it should simply have a 5 or so function interfaces, which say: shuffle, last, play/pause, next, loop. And then the audio engine only has to account for logic for those 5 instances, and if there are no up and coming songs, then doing x, and so on; rather than the incredibly clumsy solution that I had last time.
