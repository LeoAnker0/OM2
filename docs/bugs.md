# Bugs
A list of bugs that I have found, which I thought were to annoying to fix at the time that I found them.

UI:
* When changing the width of the viewport, (specifically when opening and closing that side bar in arc) the TopTitleText of the LCD has the text overflowing sometimes when the view port changes. It's really quite a minor bug/error, but one that I could do without.
